# Bankist-Application

An Application which pretty much work like a real Bank Application.

There 2 built in profiles of user whose login credentials are -
1. user - Ashwin Dhuriya (me) ; ID - ad ; Password/Pin - 1111
2. user - Aman Ali (my friend) ; ID - aa ; Password/Pin - 2222

We can login with both the account credentials and each one contains all the records of transaction i.e. deposits and withdrawals, total Money, total withdrawls, total deposits, and total applicable interests!

From one account we can send money to another account, we can request loan from some X bank and we can permenently delete our account.

It also includes system of timer which will log-out user after certain period of inactivity!
We can even sort our all transactions based on their value!
